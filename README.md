The code is developed using eclipse ide. Download the code and import into eclipse as Maven project.
Junits are added. Please run the junit.
Please run the LeagueTableMain, to test the complete table mock data mentioned in the class.

Please download the code from Github : https://github.com/arfpnm/LeagueTable.git

Please Note:

The calculations for some of the fields like Goal Against, Goal For and Goal Differences are based on my understanding, which is mentioned below:

1) Goal Against: homeTeamScore
2) Goal Against : HomeTeamScore
3) Goal Differences : HomeTeamScore - AwayTeamScore;

And same follows to the Away Team.
